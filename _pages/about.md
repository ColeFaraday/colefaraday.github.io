I am Coleridge (Cole) Faraday, a PhD student in theoretical physics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa. My research is within high-energy nuclear theory, focusing on the *quark-gluon plasma*---a novel state of matter that is formed at extremely high temperatures and densities.

## Research interests

- Jet quenching and energy loss
- Quark-gluon plasma formation in small systems
- Phenomenology and tomography in heavy-ion collisions

For details on my research, please refer to my [INSPIRE page](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2661508) and my [CV]({{ base_path }}/home/cv/).
