<div id="abs_Faraday:2024gzx" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
We present an energy loss model which includes small system size corrections to both the radiative and elastic energy loss. Our model is used to compute the nuclear modification factor \(R_AB\) of light and heavy flavor hadrons, averaged over realistic collision geometries for central and peripheral \(A+A\) and central \(p / d / ^3\textHe + A\) collisions at LHC and RHIC. We find that the predicted suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss. Our results are keenly sensitive to the crossover between elastic energy loss calculated with hard thermal loop propagators and vacuum propagators, respectively, which leads to a large theoretical uncertainty. We find that the \(R_AB\) is largely insensitive to the form of the elastic energy loss distribution - Gaussian or Poisson - surprisingly so in small systems where the central limit theorem is inapplicable. We present an expansion of the \(R_AB\) in terms of the moments of the energy loss probability distribution, which allows for a rigorous understanding of the dependence of the \(R_AB\) on the underlying energy loss distribution.

We present quantitative predictions for the nuclear modification factor in both small and peripheral systems from a pQCD-based energy loss model that is constrained by light- and heavy-flavor suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions. We find nearly identical suppression for central \(p / d + A\) collisions as for peripheral \(A + A\) collisions, quantitatively consistent with the measured 20% suppression of neutral pions produced in \(d + \mathrmAu\) collisions by PHENIX, but dramatically inconsistent with the measured 20% enhancement of charged hadrons produced in \(p + \mathrmPb\) collisions by ATLAS. We demonstrate that this equivalence of central small system suppression and peripheral large system suppression is insensitive to the underlying energy loss model.

We present suppression results for high-\(p_T\) \(D\) and \(\pi\) mesons produced in \(p / d + A\) and \(A+A\) collisions at RHIC and LHC. These results are computed using a convolved elastic and radiative energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections to both the elastic and radiative energy loss. We observe that suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss; furthermore, we find that our model is acutely sensitive to the transition between hard thermal loop and vacuum propagators in the elastic energy loss. Finally, we consider the central limit theorem approximation, which is commonly used to model the elastic energy loss distribution as Gaussian.

We present suppression predictions from our pQCD-based energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections, for high-\(p_T\) \(\pi\), \(D\) and \(B\) meson \(R_AB\) as a function of centrality, flavor, \(\sqrts_NN\), and \(p_T\) from large to small collision systems at RHIC and LHC. A statistical analysis is used to constrain the effective strong coupling in our model to available high-\(p_T\) suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, yielding good agreement with all available data. We estimate two important theoretical uncertainties in our model, stemming from: the transition between vacuum and hard thermal loop propagators in the collisional energy loss, and from the angular cutoff on the radiated gluon momentum. We find, consistently, that the extracted \(\alpha_s\) remains relatively unchanged across heavy- and light-flavor final states and across central, semi-central, and peripheral collisions. We make predictions from our large-system-constrained model for small systems and find good agreement with photon-normalized \(R^\pi^0_d \textAu \simeq 0.75 \) in \(0-5%\) centrality \(d\) + Au collisions by PHENIX. However, we find strong disagreement with the measured \(R^h^\pm_p \textPb \gtrsim 1\) in \(0-5%\) centrality \(p\) + Pb collisions by ALICE and ATLAS; we argue that this disagreement is due, in large part, to centrality bias. We make predictions for the ratio of suppression in \(^3\)He + Au and \(p\) + Au collisions, which may in the future be used to disentangle final- from initial-state suppression in small systems. We then compare our results to various subsets of data, which allows us to estimate the preferred: low-\(p_T\) scale at which non-perturbative processes become important, scales at which the strong coupling runs, and scale at which vacuum propagators transition to thermally modified propagators in collisional energy loss.

We extend the Djordjevic-Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (DGLV) model, which describes
jet energy dissipation in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a phenomenon observed in high-energy
particle collisions at the LHC and RHIC. Derived from perturbative quantum chromodynamics
(pQCD), the model presents complex challenges in extracting observable predictions. Our goal
is to simplify the QGP’s geometry while maintaining accuracy, enabling quantitative predictions
comparable to experimental data. The focus is on capturing both hydrodynamic and geometric
features of the QGP, with a simplification that allows numerical models to converge efficiently.

We present first results for leading hadron suppression in small collision systems, from a convolved radiative and collisional pQCD energy loss model which receives a short path length correction to the radiative energy loss. We find that the short path length correction is exceptionally large for light flavor final states in both small and large collision systems, due to the disproportionate size of the correction for gluons. We examine various assumptions underlying the energy loss model through the calculation of energy loss weighted expectation values of ratios assumed small by the various assumptions. This calculation shows that the large formation time assumption, which is utilized by most contemporary energy loss models, is invalid for a large portion of the phenomenologically relevant parameter space.

We present leading hadron suppression predictions in \(Pb+Pb\) and \(p+Pb\) collisions from a convolved radiative and collisional energy loss model in which partons propagate through a realistic background, and in which the radiative energy loss receives a short pathlength correction. We find that the short pathlength correction is small for \(D\) meson \(R_AA(p_T)\) in both \(Pb+Pb\) and \(p+Pb\) collisions. However the short pathlength correction leads to a surprisingly large reduction in suppression for \(\pi\) mesons in \(p+Pb\) and even \(Pb+Pb\) collisions, providing a qualitative explanation for the rapid rise in \(\pi\) meson \(R_AA(p_T)\) at the LHC. We find that the size of the short pathlength correction to \(R_AA(p_T)\) is acutely sensitive to the chosen distribution of scattering centers in the plasma. Furthermore we find that conventional elastic energy loss models, which apply the central limit theorem to the number of scatterings, dramatically overpredict suppression in \(\mathrmp+\mathrmA\) collisions, calling for short pathlength corrections to elastic energy loss.

The Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a novel state of matter which last occurred naturally only microseconds after the Big Bang. It is well understood that the QGP is formed in heavy-ion collisions at particle colliders such as the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC); however, more recently there have been experimental signatures of QGP formation in small systems including proton heavy-ion and even proton proton collisions. We present a model for energy loss of high momentum particles based on perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD), which includes small system size corrections to both the collisional and radiative energy loss. We make quantitative comparisons with suppression measurements of pions produced in central \(p + \mathrmPb\) and Pb + Pb collisions at the LHC, and \(d + \mathrmAu\) and Au + Au collisions at RHIC.
We discuss an uncertainty present in our model in the elastic energy loss sector, which is related to the crossover between Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) and vacuum propagators. Finally, we consider the applicability of the central limit theorem which is typically used to approximate the elastic energy loss distribution as a Gaussian distribution.

We present the first leading hadron suppression predictions in \(\mathrmPb+\mathrmPb\) and \(\mathrmp+\mathrmPb\) collisions from a convolved radiative and collisional energy loss model in which partons propagate through a realistic background and in which the inelastic energy loss receives a short pathlength correction. We find that the short pathlength correction is small for \(D\) and \(B\) meson \(R_AA(p_T)\) in both \(\mathrmPb+\mathrmPb\) and \(\mathrmp+\mathrmPb\) collisions. However the short pathlength correction leads to a surprisingly large reduction in suppression for \(\pi\) mesons in \(\mathrmp+\mathrmPb\) and even \(\mathrmPb+\mathrmPb\) collisions. We systematically check the consistency of the assumptions used in the radiative energy loss derivation - such as collinearity, softness, and large formation time - with the final numerical model. While collinearity and softness are self-consistently satisfied in the final numerics, we find that the large formation time approximation breaks down at modest to high momenta \(p_T \gtrsim 30\) GeV. We find that both the size of the small pathlength correction to \(R_AA(p_T)\) and the \(p_T\) at which the large formation time assumption breaks down are acutely sensitive to the chosen distribution of scattering centers in the plasma.

We show that an integral assumption in DGLV radiative energy loss - the large formation time assumption - is violated at high-\(p_T\) for phenomenologically relevant parameters. We further investigate the phenomenological impact of placing a new kinematic bound on the radiated gluon transverse momentum, which ensures that there are no contributions to the energy loss from regions of parameter space that violate the large formation time assumption. We find that this places a large sensitivity on the exact kinematic cutoff used, similar to the known collinear cutoff sensitivity, indicating the theoretical need for a rederivation of DGLV radiative energy with the large formation time assumption relaxed in order to make rigorous predictions. We additionally find that this large formation time cutoff dramatically reduces the size of a short pathlength correction to the DGLV radiative energy loss, which is of phenomenological interest in predicting suppression in small \(p +A\) systems. We compute the phenomenological predictions utilizing this large formation time cutoff in both \(p+A\) and \(A+A\) collisions at the LHC, in a convolved radiative and elastic energy loss model.
